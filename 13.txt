Do not forget to wear a facemask before stepping out.
Carry a soap paper, small soap bar or an alcohol-based hand sanitiser to office.
Carry your own power bank and charger to avoid borrowing it from a colleague.
If you are using your personal vehicle, make sure to disinfect the most-touched parts of the car once more, including the door and door handle, dash, steering wheel and gear lever, seat and seat belt, before you start. Clean your two-wheeler similarly, that is, sanitise the frequently touched parts.
