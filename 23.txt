How should office spaces be cleaned during the coronavirus disease pandemic?
Office spaces, including conference rooms should be cleaned every morning and evening after office hours before the rooms are occupied. If contact surface is visibly dirty, it should be cleaned with soap and water prior to disinfection. If possible, it should be sanitised after every use in a day.

Prior to cleaning, the worker should wear disposable rubber boots, gloves (heavy duty), and a triple layer mask.
