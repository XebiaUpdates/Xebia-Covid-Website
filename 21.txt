Children should never be allowed to go outside for playing or cycling
All the items brought from the market should be properly wash with soap or sanitized.
Avoid organising get togethers at home and in the same way avoid going and meeting to family and friends.
Avoid ordering food from outside, if really want to have that keep below points in mind before enjoying it:
Transfer the food into a clean container, throw the packaging into the garbage bin, and immediately wash your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds.
Or use household bleach to disinfect the food packaging of your ordered-in meals. Wiping over surfaces with household bleach will inactivate the virus within one minute.
Heat the food before consumption in case it is not hot already.
Wash your hands thoroughly and enjoy your meal.
If you have pets at home, make sure they are wandering inside the house only. Their hygiene is as important as our when they are staying with us at home.
