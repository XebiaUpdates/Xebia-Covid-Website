As much as possible, keep away from other people and pets in your home.
Wear a cloth face covering (or face mask, if you have one) if they must be around other people. Cloth face coverings are for use only by people older than 2 years old who are not having trouble breathing. Do not leave a child alone while they're wearing a cloth face covering. To see how to put on and remove cloth face coverings and face masks, clean them, or make your own cloth face covering.
Cover cough and sneeze with a tissue, throw the tissue away, and then wash the hand right away. Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
If possible, stay in a bedroom and use a bathroom separate from other people in the home.
Use separate dishes, glasses, cups, and eating utensils and not share these with other household members. After use, run them through the dishwasher or wash with very hot soapy water.
Use separate bedding and towels and not share these with other household members.
